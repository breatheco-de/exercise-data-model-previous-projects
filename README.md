# Data Modeling all your Previous projects

It is the first time we focus only on how to modal data, but the students have been using different data structures on their projects without even thinking about why they were defined like that, for example:

**In the TODO list project** we used an array to store all our application data like this:
```js
let todos = ['Do the replits','Read the lessons', 'Finish and deliver the projects'];
```

**In the excuse generator** we used several arrays to store each piece of the execuse like this:
```js
let who = ['the dog','my granma','his turtle','my bird'];
let what = ['eat','pissed','crushed','broked'];
let when = ['before the class','right in time','when I finished','during my lunch','while I was praying'];
```

## But what about the rest of the exercises?

There has always to be a way of storing your application needs and that its what we call the beginning of `Data Modeling`.

## Instructions
